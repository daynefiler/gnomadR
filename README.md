## gnomadR: Query gnomAD API from R <img src="man/figures/gnomadR.png" width="150" align="right" />

This package intends to provide an interface between R and the [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) API, powered by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). This package utilizes the [qhql](https://docs.ropensci.org/ghql/) R package to send queries to gnomAD. 

*Currently, the gnomAD API hsa very low query size and query rate limits, limiting the utility.*

I would happily welcome contributions or requests for query functionality.

Also, check out the [gnomAD Python API](https://github.com/furkanmtorun/gnomad_python_api) from [Furkan M. Torun (@furkanmtorun)](https://github.com/furkanmtorun).
